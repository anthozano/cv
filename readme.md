# CV Anthony Lozano

This is my personnal Curriculum Vitae, made in simple HTML/CSS. Just open `index.html` in a browser to see it.

I chose HTML to keep it simple, and giving myself more liberty and control over the final result.

Since it's just a CV, it's purpose is to be printed, or rendered as a single page.

For this, I advise using your browser to render it in a pdf file (don't forget to remove the margins).
